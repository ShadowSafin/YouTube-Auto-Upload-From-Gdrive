# YouTube-Auto-Upload-From-Gdrive
This is a python script that could randomly take a file from a Google Drive folder and upload it to YouTube with the file name as tittle and description. After upload it will move the file to another folder to avoid reuploading.

# Authentication
To make the script work change add the Google drive API OAuth2.0 file as "credentials.json" and YouTube data v3 API client secret as "client_secret.json" in the folder.

# Folder ID
(Source_File_ID) and (Destination_Folder_ID) should be changed with your desired folder id.
